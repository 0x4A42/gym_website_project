# gym_website_project
This repo contains a university project which was centered around creating a webapp for a personal trainer/gym, using a stack of PHP, jQuery, MySQL, HTML and CSS. 

## Live website
The live version of the website is available at jbrown88.lampt.eeecs.qub.ac.uk/gymafi/

## Functionality
- Allows a public user to browse website content which promotes the business, contact the business and sign up.
- Provides scalability in the amount of users (or admins, through use of a superadmin) without interference from the developer
- Allows a user to sign up, reset their password (generating a random code to confirm their identity, and then a randomly generated password), change all personal details/tracked stats and training regime, alongside the ability to delete their account.
- Allows users to create appointments, alongside creating logs to monitor progress after appointments; the coach can then update and add their own comments to these.
- Allows the coach (admin) to manually approve/reject applications from user sign ups and user created appointments
- Allows the coach to create groups of users, who will have a collective training schedule for the group
- Has an internal messaging system, complete with attachment functionality. Allows a user to message their coach or any group they are a part of, and allows a coach to message one, many, or all of their clients.
- Allows the user to upload images to a gallery, which then can be used for profile pictures.
- Allows the coach to manage website content and edit select user details (username, email address), as well as reset their password (randomly generated) or delete their account. The superadmin can edit the coach/admin account details in the same way as a coach can edit a client; with the added functionality of creating additional coaches.
